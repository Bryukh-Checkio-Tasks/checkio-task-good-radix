    In mathematical numeral systems, the radix or base is the number of unique digits, including zero,
    that a positional numeral system uses to represent numbers.
    For example, for the decimal system the radix is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9.
    In the system with radix 13, for example,
    a string of digits such as 398 denotes the decimal number 3 * 13^2 + 9 * 13^1 + 8 * 13^0.
    For the systems with the radix more than 10, we will use capital Latin symbols from A to Z, where A = 10, B = 11 ...

<p>
    You are given a some number written as a string with the radix equal to <strong>K (2 &lt; K &lt; 36)></strong>.
    We know that our number is divisible by <strong>(K - 1)</strong> without remainder.
    You should find the minimal possible K, if it exist, or return 0.
